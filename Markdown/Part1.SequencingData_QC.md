# WGS data

## Data download and backup

Sequencing data were downloaded from the NW Genomics Center using Globus software. The raw data (.tar files) have been saved to three locations:
  1. An external hard drive in my office
  2. The HauserLab fireproof external hard drive: ioSafe_HauserLab/Herring_Eleni/Herring_WholeGenomeSequencing_WA_AK
  3. Klone: /gscratch/scrubbed/elpetrou

*NB: We should also back up the data on LOLO archive

For each of these data backups, I used the MD5sum file to verify that the data were not corrupted. 

## Plot distribution of raw sequences per sample

I plotted the distribution of raw sequencing reads for each herring sample [using this R script](https://github.com/EleniLPetrou/herring_whole_genome_sequencing/blob/main/Scripts/plot_distro_raw_seqs.R).
These data were provided to me by the NW Genomics Sequencing Center in .csv format. 

![raw seq distro](https://github.com/EleniLPetrou/herring_whole_genome_sequencing/blob/11a515129c73adc8c18a78f0db3a0f224e851bee/Markdown/raw_seq_distro.jpeg) 

Here is a summary of the raw sequencing data :
  - We sequenced 556 herring (number of WA samples = 281; number of AK samples = 275)
  - Average number of reads per sample = 12.88 million reads
  - Range = 0 to 80.06 million reads
  - Standard deviation = 4.41 million reads
  - Seven samples sequenced poorly (reads per sample less than 2 sd from the mean)
  -     SMBY15_012  SMBY15_018  SQUA14_045   BERN16_004  BERN16_010  BERN16_032 BERN16_031
  - Nine samples sequenced very deeply (reads per sample more than 2 sd from mean)
  -     CHPT16_041  ELBY15_118  ELBY15_129  ELBY15_177  QLBY19_080  QLBY19_097  BERN16_033  OLGA19_003  SITKA17_043

## Unzip data

I unzipped the data on Klone [using this script](https://github.com/EleniLPetrou/herring_whole_genome_sequencing/blob/main/Scripts/gunzip.sh)

## Run FastQC

To check the quality of the raw sequence data I ran the software FastQC [using this script](https://github.com/EleniLPetrou/herring_whole_genome_sequencing/blob/main/Scripts/fastqc.sh) on Klone

```

##### ENVIRONMENT SETUP ##########
DATADIR=/mmfs1/gscratch/scrubbed/elpetrou/fastq
OUTDIR=/mmfs1/gscratch/scrubbed/elpetrou/fastqc
MYSUFFIX=.fastq

#### CODE FOR JOB #####
## make output directory
mkdir $OUTDIR

## navigate into directory holding fastq files
cd $DATADIR 

# Run fastqc on all files that end in a particular suffix ( in this case, .fastq)
for SAMPLEFILE in *$MYSUFFIX
do
	fastqc -f fastq --extract \
	$SAMPLEFILE
done

## Move all the fastqc results files (ending in _fastqc, .zip, .html) to the output directory
mv *.html $OUTDIR
mv *.zip $OUTDIR
mv *_fastqc $OUTDIR

```

## Visualize FastQC output using MultiQC

I visualized the voluminous FastQC output using MultiQC software on Klone [using this script](https://github.com/EleniLPetrou/herring_whole_genome_sequencing/blob/main/Scripts/multiqc.sh)

```
srun -p compute-hugemem -A merlab --nodes=1 \
--ntasks-per-node=1 --time=02:00:00 \
--mem=100G --pty /bin/bash


# Specify the path and the name of the singularity you want to use
DATADIR=/mmfs1/gscratch/scrubbed/elpetrou/fastqc

cd $DATADIR


# Load the singularity module
module load singularity
MYSINGULARITY=/mmfs1/gscratch/merlab/singularity_sif/containerised_ATACseq_pipeline_multiqc.sif

# Use the singularity exec command to use the singularity and run commands that are specific to the software it contains (VCFtools, in this case)

singularity exec \
$MYSINGULARITY \
multiqc .


```

The sequencing quality looks really great for almost all samples, hurray!

Below you can see the adapter content in one sample (CHPT16_041_R1). Bloody hell, that is a lot of adapter content for a sample that was cleaned at 0.65X Ampure beads and whose average library size was probably around 750 bp. I guess I should have been more brutal during size selection, ugh.
